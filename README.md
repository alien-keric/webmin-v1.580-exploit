# webmin-v1.580-exploit
webmin remote code execution v1.580


# Desciption
webmin v1.580 is vulnerable to remote command execution , in which attacker can bind invalid random characters and malicious command with a pipeline(|) and get executed on the server which result to rce,actually there multiple ways to exploit this one is by using metasploit and another is by using online scripts wrote by others hackers. But today i decided to write my write my own python script which does the same thing


## IDEA BEHIND
The idea behind the script is from a metasploit script written in ruby, so i was reading and try to change it into my own python code 

## RESOURCES USED
1. https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/21851
2. https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2012-2982
3. stackover flow, chart gpt and gemini
4. tryhackme

## USAGE
The usage of the script is simple you just need to change the
1. targetIP = target machine
2. credentials should be changed from (username,password) to valid credentials
3. remember to start the netcat listener and input ur ip address
4. Final command should be run

**command: python3 panda.py**

NB: make sure you have valid credential for the exploit to work
